## About

Based on an [application](https://github.com/jrmedd/PatternBeats) and [composition/performance](https://vimeo.com/184729486#t=22m14s) I began working on in 2016, I was asked by Gemma @ PatternCraft to create a tutorial/workshop around **PatternBeats**. As well as porting the application to run on multiple platforms (including Raspberry Pi), I'm working on some learning materials to accompany the app.

## Installation

To install. Clone or download/unzip the entire repo. Open Chrome or Chromium (**sudo apt-get install chromium-browser** on your Pi) and head to **chrome://extensions**. Enable **Developer mode** and then **Load unpacked extension**, selecting the entire directory. Then hit launch and you're good to go. The preferred serial port is **/dev/ACM0**, which, if present, will connect automatically.

**THIS APPLICATION IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT, AND THERE ARE CHANGES I'VE YET TO PUSH HERE!**
